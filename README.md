## Grabup for Linux
Grabup for Linux is a collection of scripts designed to automate the taking and sharing of screenshots.

## Requirements
 * Linux/BSD Host
 * Xorg Server
 * scrot 
 * imagemagick 
 * notify-send(1)
 * curl
 * xclip

## Install
Place the client scripts on the machine to take the screenshots on, and install the server scripts on your server.
The server-side portion should work on PHP5+, but is untested with anything less than 5.3 (oldstable).

## Usage
Invoke the script, and click and drag a box around what you want to take a screenshot of. You can abort the screenshot by pressing "Esc".
Once the upload is complete, a notication will be displayed. You may then click your middle mouse button to paste a link the screenshot in any text field.
